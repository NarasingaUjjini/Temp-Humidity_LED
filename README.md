# Temp-Humidity_LED
DHT22 Sensor detects Temperature and Humidity, and adjusts LED lights to display crossed thresholds

# Regarding All LEDs being ON:
All of the LEDs are set to HIGH if the temperature exceeds 20 degrees Celcius. I am still looking for a method to create an adjustable environment to test the sensor's fidelity.
